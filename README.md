Spawn in `SCP 682` entity to use.
Upon interacting with the entity, you will turn into SCP 682. This removes all weapons from your inventory and gives you an SCP 682 SWEP.
Left Clicking with the SWEP attacks in an AOE in front of you. Right Clicking makes you roar, which slows and disables the weapons of nearby players temporarily (I can't seem to figure out how to disable NPC weapons).
At the top you will see a UI that lets you know what your current regenerative force is at.
This dictates your max HP and your regen. You gain regenerative force by killing players/NPCs, and you lose it by taking damage.

Do note that this uses the SCP 682 model from this addon: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2830971578
I have yet to learn how to include models in addons, so at the moment I just use this one, as I already had it installed.
